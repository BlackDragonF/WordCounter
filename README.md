# WordCounter

The course design from Computer Science and Technology Department in HUST.

A word counter program based on Trie Tree and Hash Table.

The programmer of this word counter - BlackDragon - is an undergraduate of HUST. 

Any discussion or suggestion is welcomed, but you SHOULD NOT copy the code directly if you are facing the same/similar course design. After all, copying the codes won't make you stronger :)

## Ideas

The program will be devided into two parts - backend and frontend.

Backend will provide the core implementation of counting word, including pretreatment of text files, the initialization and management of certain data structures, and wrapping/abstraction api.

Frontend will provide GUI for the program(It depends on whether I have enough time qwq).

### Backend

#### Pretreatment

Pretreatment aims at extracting words from given text file and generate a temp file for following steps.
